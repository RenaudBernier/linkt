### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd linkt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Create and Initialize Database

Navigate to the database directory and run the Python script to create the SQLite database with seed data:

```bash
python3 backend/database/create_database.py
```

This will:
- Create a new `linkt.db` file in the database directory
- Set up all required tables (user, event, ticket, saved_event)

  - 3 organizers (2 approved, 1 pending)
  - 3 students
  - 1 administrator
  - 3 sample events
  - Sample tickets and saved events

### 2. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend/springboot-app
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Start the Frontend Development Server

In a new terminal, from the root directory:

```bash
cd frontend/my-react-app
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port)
